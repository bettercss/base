<p class="u-text-emphasize">This library sets basic styles for common html elements.</p>

When starting your new project using Bettercss, You'll need to make sure you have some base element styles set first. Much like a reset does this library provides stylings for some of the following tags `html, headings, tables and links`. This ensures your project starts with the best possibly foundations for the rest of your project to work from.

We suggest you use our base module but it's not requirement, you can read more about project builds in our [Getting Started Guide](http://bettercss.github.io/docs/)
