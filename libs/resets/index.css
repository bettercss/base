 *    automatically zooming fonts. Importantly this ensures iOS Safari matches
 *    the page width to wider landscape viewports instead of zooming everything.
 *    Unlike none, a value of 100% allows users to still pinch-zoom. These rules
 *    appear in Normalize.css, which is in turn used in the HTML5 Boilerplate
 *    and Bootstrap.
 * 3. Fonts on OS X will look more consistent with other systems that do not
 *    render text using sub-pixel anti-aliasing.
